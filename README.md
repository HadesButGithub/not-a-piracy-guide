## Introduction
For those coming from my shared Jellyfin, this was mainly made for you to help you achieve the best experience while watching movies and TV shows 100% legally after the shutdown. For everyone else, this is _not_ a piracy guide and will not assist you in breaking all sorts of copyright law to download free media like movies, TV, music, games, and anime. 

Sarcasm aside, this is my quick, simple guide to pirating media with ease and convenience. With tiers for those willing to spend a bit, a lot, or nothing at all, you're guaranteed to leave this Github page with some free sh\*t.

## Disclaimer
While I've done my best to vet all of these sites to ensure they don't contain malware or other malicious things, things may slip through the gaps, and I take ***absolutely ZERO responsibility*** for any damage done to your system by accessing **any** of the sites in this list (even for those marked as my personal recommendation). Multiple incidents have occured where previously reputable sites have turned rogue and began distributing malware. It also may occur that user error is a factor in causing issues.

I also take zero responsibility for any legal issues that arise from using this guide. Issues can include, but are not limited to, DMCA letters, suspension of internet service, fines, etc.

## What should you actually use?
There's a lot of sites and resources that will be listed here, and you might end up being overwhelmed. The website or service that I would recommend in each section and cost tier is marked with **bold text**.

## Cost Tiers
> But wait, I thought the point of pirating my media was so that it would be free?

Don't worry, all sections will have a free tier. However, you get what you pay for, and paying for services like Real-Debrid or a VPN (both of which I'll talk about in more detail later) can improve your experience tenfold. The majority of free services listed will have slower speeds, lower resolution content, more ads, and an overall worse experience compared to paid services. Again, you get what you pay for.
