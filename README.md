## Introduction
For those coming from my shared Jellyfin, this was mainly made for you to help you achieve the best experience while watching movies and TV shows 100% legally after the shutdown. For everyone else, this is _not_ a piracy guide and will not assist you in breaking all sorts of copyright law to download free media like movies, TV, music, games, and anime. 

Sarcasm aside, this is my quick, simple guide to pirating media with ease and convenience. With cost tiers for those willing to spend a bit, a lot, or nothing at all, you're guaranteed to leave this Github page with some pirated media.

## Disclaimer
While I've done my best to vet all of these sites to ensure they don't contain malware or other malicious things, things may slip through the gaps, and I take ***absolutely ZERO responsibility*** for any damage done to your system by accessing **any** of the sites in this list (even for those marked as my personal recommendation). Multiple incidents have occured where previously reputable sites have turned rogue and began distributing malware. It also may occur that user error is a factor in causing issues.

I also take zero responsibility for any legal issues that arise from using this guide. Issues can include, but are not limited to, DMCA letters, suspension of internet service, fines, etc.

## What should you actually use?
There's a lot of sites and resources that will be listed here, and you might end up being overwhelmed. The website or service that I would recommend in each section and cost tier is marked with a ⭐.

## Tiers
Each section will be tiered based on a variety of factors that may change depending on the subject. These factors mainly relate to time and money.

### Required Services
* Requires Real-Debrid - The app or website requires a Real-Debrid subscription to function.
* Requires VPN - The app or website requires a paid VPN to avoid copyright notices (which you'll want to do).

### Cost
* Subscription  - The app or site requires a monthly, yearly, or other subscription.
* One-Time - The app or site requires a one-time payment.
* Free - The app or site does not require payment.

## "What the f\*ck is a torrent?" and Other Questions You May Have
Piracy introduces a lot of new standards, technologies, and other things that don't exist or are completely hidden to the user on legal services. This introduces a swarm of new questions that I'll do my best to answer.

### > What the f\*ck is a torrent?

When downloading pirated media, a torrent is the most common download type you'll find, and basically every site will have them available. To explain what they are, I'll need to explain Direct Download as well.

In most cases, files downloaded or streamed from the internet are downloaded from one central server. When you stream from Netflix, you stream from Netflix's server. When you download a game from Steam, you download from Steam's server. Obviously, bigger companies will have hundreds or even thousands of servers around the globe for the fastest download performance, but that's the gist of it.

![Diagram showing DDL process](SCR-20221119-txf.png)

^^ That diagram is a serious oversimplification, but that's all it is. In the case of services like Netflix or Disney+, this is the best solution from a user and sys-admin perspective for a variety of reasons. When you're sailing the seven seas, Direct Download (DDL) unfortunately makes files much more likely to be taken down.

This is where torrents come in. Torrents completely remove the need for a central server by making _you_ (and everyone else downloading the file) the server. When you open a .torrent file or a magnet link in your torrent client, you begin downloading the file from everyone else downloading the file. Plus, when someone else starts downloading the file, you'll start uploading the file as well, even if you haven't finished the download yet. When you start uploading, you're what's known as a "seeder". Downloading without seeding is known as "leeching", and is generally frowned upon within the piracy community.

![Diagram showing torrent process](SCR-20221119-ue9.png)

Torrents are also practically impossible to take down. While you could take down the website providing the .torrent file that tells your torrent client where to look for the file(s), you can't take down a torrent unless everyone seeding the file stops seeding it.

Torrents do bring up issues with obscure content though. If a file doesn't have many seeders, the download speed will be much slower than something with many seeders. For files like these, DDL is better.

*To clarify, torrenting as a download method is not illegal, just like using Chrome to DDL is not illegal.*

### > Why do I need a VPN?

A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, masks your IP making you more anonymous when you're on the internet. You've probably heard this phrase in a hundred different wordings from the hundreds of YouTubers sponsored by NordVPN/Surfshark/ExpressVPN/Private Internet Access/\[insert other VPN\], and this IP address masking is seriously helpful when torrenting files.

Because of the peer-to-peer (P2P) nature of torrents, your IP address is leaked to every other person downloading the torrent. This would usually be fine, but big movie studios will hire companies to download these torrents (known as copyright trolls), look through all of the IP addresses, send notices to your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and make them send you threatening letters or even cut off your internet. When using a VPN, the other peers in the download will see the IP of your VPN, including the copyright trolls. If you have a good VPN for torrenting, your VPN provider will receive the copyright notice, not know who the IP belongs to, and tell the copyright troll to get f\*cked in nice legal terms.

If you're using DDL or Real-Debrid, you usually don't need to worry about a VPN.

### > What is Real-Debrid?

See [Real-Debrid](https://github.com/HadesButGithub/not-a-piracy-guide#real-debrid).

## I'm an iPhone User, What Should I Do?
Piracy on iPhone is a lot more difficult than on desktop platforms or on Android. iOS apps will be provided when possible, and streaming sites will always work.

## Use These Browser Extensions
You should use these. All links provided direct to the Firefox addon store because Firefox is just better. Don't have Firefox? [Download it.](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

* **[uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)** - Finally, an efficient wide-spectrum content blocker. Easy on CPU and memory. ***You should seriously install this.*** (use Firefox Focus or Brave on iOS for adblocking capabilities)
* **[SponsorBlock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sponsorblock/)** - Easily skip YouTube video sponsors.
* **[Return YouTube Dislikes](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/return-youtube-dislikes)** - Returns ability to see dislike statistics on youtube
* **[Bypass Paywalls Clean](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bypass-paywalls-clean/)** - Bypass Paywalls of news sites

## VPNs
I'll preface this by saying that you should *never, ever* use a free VPN while torrenting. ***EVER.*** They will not protect you in any way. You must have a reputable, paid VPN (with one exception). Ideally, something from this list. Also, VPNs are recommended wherever possible, even if a site is in the "No VPN Required".

All VPNs fall under None for commitment, and setup usually falls under Instant (as in noodles).

### Paid (***highly recommended***)
All of these fall under the Subscription tier.

* **[Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net/en/)** ⭐ - Mullvad is a VPN service that helps keep your online activity, identity, and location private. Doesn't require *any* personal information to sign-up (no email, phone, or username), and you can use crypto, cheques, and even cash to remain as anonymous as possible, along with more standard payment methods. (€5/month, billed monthly)
* **[Windscribe VPN](https://windscribe.com)** - Windscribe helps you mask your physical location, circumvent censorship, and block ads and trackers on websites you use every day. I would suggest using [Build a Plan](https://windscribe.com/upgrade) to get unlimited bandwidth and your countries pro servers for $2USD a month (billed monthly). ($9USD/month billed monthly for Pro, with discounts available for paying in yearly plans)
* **[ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/)** - High-speed Swiss VPN that safeguards your privacy. ***Free plan does not support torrenting.*** ($10USD/month billed monthly, with discounts available for paying in 1 or 2 year plans)

### Free
* **Windscribe VPN (again)** ⭐ - Windscribe also has a free plan with 10GB of monthly bandwidth. This is the only option I would recommend for free torrenting, but only for smaller files.

Most of these providers have guides for safely torrenting over a VPN:
* Windscribe: https://windscribe.com/support/article/21/using-windscribe-with-torrent-clients
* Mullvad: https://web.archive.org/web/20200125180636/https://mullvad.net/en/help/bittorrent/
* ProtonVPN: https://protonvpn.com/support/bittorrent-vpn/

Wherever possible, you should be binding your torrent client to the VPN. You should also perform an IP leak check through [IPLeak](https://ipleak.net). You can find a guide on how to do this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNTorrents/comments/7saz0b/how_to_make_sure_your_ip_doesnt_leak_when_you/). After checking that the IP shown in the browser after enabling torrent leak detection matches with the IP shown in the VPN client, you should be 99.99% safe.

Using these guides and binding your client usually falls under Slightly Annoying for time and None for commitment.

## DDL Clients
Downloading large files in your browser can be a hassle, so you can use one of these to make it better.

### Free
* **[JDownloader 2](https://jdownloader.org/)** ⭐ - JDownloader is a free, open-source download management tool with a huge community that makes downloading as easy and fast as it should be. ***CONTAINS BUNDLED ADWARE IN INSTALLER, PLEASE BE AWARE WHEN INSTALLING (software is otherwise safe)***
* **[Free Download Manager](https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/)** - A powerful modern download accelerator and organizer for Windows, macOS, Android, and Linux. 

### Paid
* **[Internet Download Manager](https://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/)** ⭐ - Internet Download Manager (IDM) is a tool to increase download speeds by up to 5 times, resume and schedule downloads. ***DO NOT PAY FOR THIS SOFTWARE!*** it's insanely easy to reset the free trial with [this app](https://github.com/J2TEAM/idm-trial-reset).

## Torrent Clients
### ***AVOID AT ALL COSTS***
* uTorrent & uTorrent Web
* BitTorrent (client, not the protocol)
While both used to be staples of torrenting, they now include ads and unwanted software, and used to bundle [crypto miners](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2893808/utorrent-installs-cryptocurrency-miner-on-user-computers.html) and [malware](https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1kfmwa/utorrent_now_comes_bundled_with_malware_called/).

### Free (don't pay for a torrent client)
* **[qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - literally the best torrent client ever created
* **[Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/)** - A Fast, Easy and Free Bittorrent Client for macOS, Windows and Linux 
* **[LibreTorrent (android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.proninyaroslav.libretorrent&hl=en_AU&gl=US)** - Free and Open Source, full-featured torrent client for Android.

## Real-Debrid
Real-Debrid falls under the tiers of Subscription,

Real-Debrid combines the best of torrents and DDLs. Real-Debrid has a massive cache of torrents from it's huge user base and scrapes premium torrents. When using Real-Debrid, you don't need to worry about a VPN, and it's much less likely you'll run into malicious software. Real-Debrid is also much faster than using torrents or DDL in most cases, and can usually max out your internet connection (if you have a 100Mbp plan, you'll be downloading at 100Mbp).

Once Real-Debrid is connected to an app like Stremio (covered later), you'll have a fantastic streaming experience with no ads, extremely fast streams, and high quality video. You can also use Real-Debrid to convert torrent links into DDL links.

This all sounds great, but it does come at a cost. You can pay for 15 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days for €3, €4, €9, or €16 respectively. 

### Sign-up guide
1. Head to the [Real-Debrid website](https://real-debrid.com/?id=8559338) (clicking that link uses my affiliate code to give me 5 days of service. a non-affiliate link is available [here](https://real-debrid.com))
2. Click 'Sign-up' in the top right corner.
3. Fill out the sign-up form and click 'Sign-up'
4. Once at your logged in page, click 'Premium Offers'
